- What is BEM??
    - BEM stands for Block, Element, and Modifier.
    - It is a Naming Convention for Css Class Names.

- Benefits of BEM:
    1. It is a Component Structure
    2. Sets a Consistent Low - Level of Specificity for Styling Selectors

- Advantages: 
    1. Easy to Maintain
    2. Class Names are Logical and Intutive
    3. Eliminates Nested CSS Selectors

- Dis-Advantages:
    1. Do not go too Deep
    2. The main rule should not use more than 2 Levels of Parent
    3. Avoids SASS @extend

- What exactly the letters B, E and M say:
    - B: stands for Block. - The Parent Element of the Component is defined as a Block.
    - E: stands for Element. - Inside of the Component may be One or More Children called Elements.
    - M: stands for Modifier. - Either a Block or Element may have a variations signed by a Modifier

    syntax:
    [block]__[element]--[modifier]

- BEM Methodology: 
    - The BEM explains the writing Class Names Uniquely and Logically

    - Block: 
        Class Names Examples: .content {}, .menu {}, .search-form {}
        Concept: header, container, menu, search

    - Element: 
        Class Names Examples: .content__article {}, .menu__item {}, .search-form__input {}
        Concept: menu item, list item, header title

    - Modifier: 
        Class Names Examples: .content__article--featured {}, .menu__item--link {}, .search-form__input--icon {}
        Concept: disabled, checked, highlight
